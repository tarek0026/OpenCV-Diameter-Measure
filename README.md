# OpenCV-Diameter-Measure
This project uses OpenCV to measure the outer and inner diameters of circular objects in images. It employs ORB feature matching and homography to align reference and target images. The circular region is isolated, and diameters are calculated. Results are displayed on the image and saved in an Excel file for further analysis.
